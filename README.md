# FEND Restaurant Reviews App Stage 1

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For this stage of the **Restaurant Reviews** project, I was tasked to create an offline capable web app using service workers that is fully accessible and responsive.

## Installation Instructions.

1. clone or download the project from my [repo](https://github.com/orangemooncreative/fend-restaurant-stage-1)
2. To view the project you can either spin up your own python server as described [here](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1) or if you use vscode like I do, all you need to do is install and run the [live server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) plugin.
3. Once the server is running open index.html with your preferred browser.

## How to change the server to a different port?

In dbhelper.js line 11 change the value of `const port = YOURPORT` to the port you would like to use for the server.

## Dependencies.

This project uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).
